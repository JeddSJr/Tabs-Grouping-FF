# Tabs Grouping FF

This repository contains a quick and dirty program designed to group Firefox tabs based on a matching term in their title or URL. 

## Features
- Automatically organizes open tabs into groups.
- Matches tabs using keywords found in their titles or URLs.

## Usage
1. Run the program.
2. Provide the term(s) to match.
3. The program will group tabs accordingly.

## Disclaimer
This is a simple utility and may not handle all edge cases. Use at your own discretion. I personally use it to just group them in one window then save that window with the [Tab Session Manager](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/tab-session-manager/)
